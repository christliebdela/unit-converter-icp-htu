# `unit-converter`

A simple and efficient unit conversion application built on the Internet Computer platform. This project allows users to convert between different units of measurement including length, weight, temperature, volume, and more.

## Features

- Convert between multiple unit types
- Clean, user-friendly interface
- Fast and accurate calculations
- Available on the Internet Computer platform

## Project Overview

This unit-converter is built using the Motoko programming language on the Internet Computer. It provides a decentralized, always-available service for unit conversions without requiring a centralized server.

## Getting Started

To get started with development on this project, you'll need to set up the Internet Computer SDK:

```bash
sh -ci "$(curl -fsSL https://internetcomputer.org/install.sh)"
```

Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/christliebdela/unit-converter-icp-htu
cd unit-converter/
```

## Development Commands

Here are some useful commands for working with this project:

```bash
# Get help with dfx commands
dfx help

# Get help with canister-specific commands
dfx canister --help
```

## Running the project locally

If you want to test your project locally, you can use the following commands:

```bash
# Starts the replica, running in the background
dfx start --background

# Deploys your canisters to the replica and generates your candid interface
dfx deploy
```

Once the job completes, your application will be available at `http://localhost:4943?canisterId={asset_canister_id}`.

If you have made changes to your backend canister, you can generate a new candid interface with

```bash
npm run generate
```

at any time. This is recommended before starting the frontend development server, and will be run automatically any time you run `dfx deploy`.

If you are making frontend changes, you can start a development server with

```bash
npm start
```

Which will start a server at `http://localhost:8080`, proxying API requests to the replica at port 4943.

### Note on frontend environment variables

If you are hosting frontend code somewhere without using DFX, you may need to make one of the following adjustments to ensure your project does not fetch the root key in production:

- set`DFX_NETWORK` to `ic` if you are using Webpack
- use your own preferred method to replace `process.env.DFX_NETWORK` in the autogenerated declarations
  - Setting `canisters -> {asset_canister_id} -> declarations -> env_override to a string` in `dfx.json` will replace `process.env.DFX_NETWORK` with the string in the autogenerated declarations
- Write your own `createActor` constructor

## Usage

Once the application is running, you can:

1. Select the type of unit you want to convert (length, weight, temperature, etc.)
2. Enter the value to convert
3. Select the source and target units
4. Get your conversion result instantly
